# E2E-thesis

This repository contains the scripts utilized in my [diploma thesis](will be linked later) written under the supervision of doc. Petr Pollak at the [Department of Circuit Theory](https://obvody.fel.cvut.cz/), [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](https://fel.cvut.cz/en), [CTU in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en).

## Abstract

...

## How to use

The scripts are somewhat commented and prepared for further utilization. Shell and Python scripts were originally run on [MetaCentrum](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/), therefore under Debian 13. MATLAB scripts were run on my home PC with Windows 11. All of the scripts should be usable under any system with a little tweaking.

### Prerequisites

The project utilizes [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io/) with all of their own prerequisites and all training was performed on [LJSpeech dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/).
